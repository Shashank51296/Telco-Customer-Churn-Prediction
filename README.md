# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
<b>Customer Churn</b> is a metric that measures the percentage of customers who discontinued their use of a company's product or service within a specified time frame. This term is widely used across different industries. However, it is most commonly applied to businesses with a contractual customer base, such as mobile phone networks and pay TV operators that operate on a subscriber-based service model. To calculate the churn rate, the number of customers lost during the defined period is divided by the total number of customers.

The churn rate can be an important indicator of various factors, such as customer dissatisfaction, a competition offering cheaper or better products or services, the competition's more effective sales and marketing strategies, or issues related to the customer life cycle.

This notebook contains exploratory data analysis of the IBM dataset. The Business objective here is to predict the telco customer churn based on the previous data.
